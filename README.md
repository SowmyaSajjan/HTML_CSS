Index.html: The code describes the structure of the webpage. First of all it has an header tag to display the name of the company which is “Food Point”. The navigation               bar contains tabs of 'Home', 'About', 'Menu' and 'ContactUs'. The navigation bar also consists of the logo of the company followed by the background image               with some more details of the “Online FoodShop” along with the featured products.

Contact.html: The code describes us what contents are present in the “ContactUs” tab in the navigation bar. We have used input tags to enter the type of                               “name”, “email-id”, “phone number” and “explanation” of the query. The form also provides “Submit” button.

OurStory.html: The code describes the story of the company which is 'Food Point' and also about it's signature food.

style.css: This is the stylesheet block which gives us the proper look of the webpage.

Header styling: It consists of two “head” tags. We have used font-style ;Open Sans', sans-serif to style the header and also used proper colors to make some text look                 attractive.

Navigation bar styling: It basically consists of logo styling and content styling. First of all we have considered the navigation bar as a flexbox and assigned the flex-                         direction to “column”. The logo desiged using by display:block. We have used the margin:auto property to center the image. Then have                                     considered the content of the navigation bar as a flexbox and then we have positioned it properly.
